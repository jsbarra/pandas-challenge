OBSERVABLE TRENDS


One clear trend that you can gather from the data tables is that Charter schools tend to perform better than district schools.
From the data tables of top performing schools and bottom performing schools (based on overall percentage passing math and reading),
you can see that the top 5 schools performance wise are all Charter schools, where as the bottom 5 schools are all district schools.
This is a very clear trend that can be drawn from the data.

Another clear trend that you can gather is that it looks like the schools with the lower budgets perform better across the board
in math and reading averages than the schools with the higher budgets per student.  This was definitely an interesting trend, as my first 
assumption would be that a higher budger per student would mean better performance, as they have more resources available to them with
a higher budget, but that is actually not the case based on the data.  The higher the per student budget, the worse they perform!
